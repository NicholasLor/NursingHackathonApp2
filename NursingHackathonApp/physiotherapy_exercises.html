      Begin these exercises now and keep doing them after surgery until your case manager or rehab team tells you to start Phase 2 Exercises. Exercise is part of a successful surgery and getting back to normal, everyday living.

      Do them on both legs so both legs are strong. Do all exercises slowly and with control. Repeat each exercise at least 5 times. You can increase the number of times as long as it doesn't hurt too much.
